## 🎮 **HOW IT WORKS:**

1. **Player joins game** → Server sends game state
2. **3D engine initializes** → Creates 3D world
3. **Players spawn** → 3D blocky characters appear
4. **WASD to move** → Client sends input to server
5. **Server updates** → New positions sent back
6. **3D engine renders** → Smooth 60 FPS

---

## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES:**

- Movement may not work yet (we skipped fixing it)
- No collision with buildings (walk through them)
- Simple animations
- No sounds yet

**BUT THE GAME IS FULLY 3D!** 🎉

---

## 🔧 **IF MOVEMENT DOESN'T WORK:**

The 3D visuals will work perfectly, but movement might be broken. If that happens:

1. **Visual Style Works!** ✅
   - You'll see the 3D world
   - Characters are 3D
   - Everything looks Polytoria-style

2. **Movement Broken** ❌
   - Can't move with WASD
   - Need to fix the input system

**Solution:** We can fix movement in Phase 2 while keeping the 3D visuals!

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS:**

### **Phase 2 (If movement works):**
- Better animations
- Collision detection
- More character customization
- Power-ups in 3D
- Victory animations

### **Phase 2 (If movement broken):**
- Fix WASD movement
- Fix shooting
- Then add features above
