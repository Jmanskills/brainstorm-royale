## 🎮 **GAMEPLAY FEATURES**

### **🚪 DOORS - Open & Close**
**How It Works:**
- All buildings have doors
- Doors START CLOSED
- Get close to door → See "Press E" prompt
- Press **E** → Door opens!
- Press **E** again → Door closes
- **EVERYONE** sees door state (synced)

**Strategy:**
- **Open doors = someone was here**
- **Closed doors = might be safe or TRAP**
- Close doors behind you to hide
- Leave doors open to bait enemies

### **🪜 STAIRS - Multiple Floors**
**How It Works:**
- Towers and apartments have 2-3 floors
- Get near stairs → See "⬆️ Q: Up  ⬇️ E: Down"
- Press **Q** → Go UP one floor
- Press **E** → Go DOWN one floor
- Your floor shown in corner: "Floor 2/3"

**Strategy:**
- **Top floors = Better loot**
- **High ground advantage** in fights
- **Trap enemies** on lower floors
- **Escape routes** via stairs

### **🏠 ROOM SYSTEM**
**What You See:**
- **Outside building:** See exterior, roof, windows
- **Inside building:** See room layout, walls, floors
- **Room names shown:** "Living Room", "Kitchen", etc.
- **Floor indicator:** Current floor shown

**How It Works:**
- Enter building through door
- Camera shows interior automatically
- Walls become semi-transparent
- See all rooms on your current floor
- Other floors hidden until you climb stairs

### **📦 CHEST SPAWNS INSIDE**
**New Behavior:**
- Chests spawn INSIDE rooms now!
- Not randomly outside
- Random room per chest
- Better loot on higher floors

**Example:**
- Apartment building: Chests in bedrooms, lobby, hallways
- House: Chests in living room, bedroom, garage
- Tower: More chests on top floor
